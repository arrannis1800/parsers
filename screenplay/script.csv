Character,Speech
 Narrator: ," In a far away land, long ago, lived a king and his fair queen. Many years had they longed for a child and finally their wish was granted. A daughter was born, and they called her Aurora. Yes, they named her after the dawn for she filled their lives with sunshine. Then a great holiday was proclaimed throughout the kingdom, so that all of high or low estate might pay homage to the infant princess. And our story begins on that most joyful day. "
 Choir: ," Joyfully now to our princess we come, Bringing gifts and all good wishes too. We pledge our loyalty anew. Hail to the princess Aurora! All of her subjects adore her! Hail to the King! Hail to the Queen! Hail to the princess Aurora! Health to the princess, Wealth to the princess, Long live the princess Aurora! Hail Aurora! Hail Aurora! Health to the princess, Wealth to the princess, Long live the princess Aurora! Hail to the King! Hail to the Queen! Hail to the princess Aurora! "
 Narrator: , Thus on this great and joyous day did all the kingdom celebrate the long awaited royal birth. And good King Stefan and his Queen made welcome their life long friend. 
 Announcer: ," Their royal highnesses, King Hubert and prince Phillip "
 Narrator: ," Fondly had these monarchs dreamed one day their kingdoms to unite. Thus today would they announce that Phillip, Huberts son and heir to Stefan's child would be betrothed. And so to her his gift he brought, and looked, unknowing, on his future bride. "
 Announcer: ," The most honored and exalted excellencies, the three good fairies. Mistress Flora, mistress Fauna, and mistress Merryweather. "
 Fairies: ,"   Oh, the little darling!   Your majesties, "
 Flora: ," Each of us the child may bless with a single gift. No more, no less.   Little princess, my gift shall be the gift of beauty. "
 Choir: ," One gift, beauty rare Full of sunshine in her hair Lips that shame the red red rose She'll walk with springtime Wherever she goes "
 Fauna: ," Tiny princess, my gift shall be the gift of song. "
 Choir: ," One gift, the gift of song Melody her whole life long The nightingale's her troubadour Bringing her sweet serenade to her door "
 Merryweather: ," Sweet princess, my gift shall be ... "
 Flora: ," Why, it's Maleficent! "
 Merryweather: , What does she want here? 
 Fauna: , Shhh! 
 Maleficent: ," Well, quite a glittering assemblage, King Stefan. Royalty, nobility, the gentry, and, how quaint, even the rebel. "
 Merryweather: , I really felt quite distressed of not receiving an invitation. 
 Merryweather: , You weren't wanted! 
 Maleficent: ," Not wa...? Oh dear, what an awkward situation. I had hoped it was merely due to some oversight. Well, in that event I'd best be on my way. "
 Queen: ," And you're not offended, your excellency? "
 Maleficent: ," Why no, your majesty. And to show I bear no ill will, I, too, shall bestow a gift on the child. "
 Maleficent: ," Listen well, all of you! The princess shall indeed grow in grace and beauty, beloved by all who know her. But, before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. "
 Queen: , Oh no!   
 Maleficent: ," Ha, ha, ha, ha! "
 Stefan: , Seize that creature! 
 Maleficent: , Stand back you fools.   
 Flora: ," Don't despair, your majesties. Merryweather still has her gift to give. "
 Stefan: , Then she can undo this fearful curse? 
 Merryweather: ," Oh no, sire. "
 Flora: , Maleficent's powers are far too great. 
 Fauna: , But she can help! 
 Merryweather: , But ... 
 Fauna: ," Just do your best, dear. "
 Flora: , Yes ... 
 Merryweather: ," Sweet princess, if through this wicked witches trick a spindle should your finger prick, a ray of hope there still may be in this, the gift I give at thee. Not in death but just in sleep the fateful prophecy you'll keep, and from this slumber you shall wake when true love's kiss the spell shall break. "
 Choir: , For true love conquers all 
 Narrator: ," But King Stefan, still fearful of his daughter's life, did then and there decree that every spinning wheel in the kingdom should on that very day be burnt. So it was done. "
 Flora: , Silly fiddle faddle! 
 Fauna: ," Now, come have a nice cup of tea, dear. I'm sure it'll work out somehow. "
 Merryweather: ," Well, a bonfire won't stop Maleficent. "
 Flora: , Of course not. But what will? 
 Fauna: ," Well, perhaps if we reason with her. "
 Flora: , Reason? 
 Merryweather: , With Maleficent? 
 Fauna: ," Well, she can't be all bad. "
 Flora: ," Oh, yes, she can. "
 Merryweather: , I'd like to turn her into a fat ole hoptoad! 
 Fauna: ," Now, dear, that isn't a very nice thing to say. "
 Flora: ," Besides, we can't. You know our magic doesn't work that way. "
 Fauna: ," It can only do good, dear, to bring joy and happiness. "
 Merryweather: ," Well, that would make me happy. "
 Flora: , But there must be some way ... There he is! 
 Merryweather: , There he is? 
 Fauna: ," What is it, Flora? "
 Flora: ," I'm going to ... shh, shh, shh! Even walls have ears. "
 Flora: , Follow me! 
 Flora: , I'll turn her into a flower! 
 Merryweather: , Maleficent? 
 Flora: ," Oh no, dear, the princess! "
 Fauna: , Oh she'd make a lovely flower. 
 Flora: ," Don't you see, a flower can't prick its finger. "
 Merryweather: , It hasn't any. 
 Fauna: , That's right. 
 Flora: , She'll be perfectly safe. 
 Merryweather: , Until Maleficent sends a frost. 
 Flora: ," Yes, a ... oh dear! "
 Fauna: , She always ruins your nicest flowers. 
 Flora: , You're right. And she'll be expecting us to do something like that. 
 Merryweather: ," But what won't she expect, she knows everything. "
 Fauna: ," Oh but she doesn't dear. Maleficent doesn't know anything about love, or kindness, or the joy of helping earnest. You know, sometimes I don't think she's really very happy. "
 Flora: ,"   That's it, of course! It's the only thing she can't understand, and won't expect.   oh, oh, now, now ... We have to plan it carefully, let's see, woodcutters cottage, yes, yes, the abandoned one, of course the King and Queen will object, but when we explain it's the only way ... "
 Merryweather: , Explain what? 
 Flora: , About the three peasant women raising a foundling child deep in the forest. 
 Fauna: ," Oh, that's very nice of them. "
 Merryweather: , Who are they? 
 Flora: , Turn around! 
 Fauna: ," iih ... why, it's ... us! "
 Merryweather: ," You mean, we, us? "
 Fauna: , Take care of the baby? 
 Flora: , Why not? 
 Fauna: ," Oh, i'd like that! "
 Merryweather: ,"   Well, yes, yes, but will we have to feed it? "
 Fauna: , And wash it and dress it and rock it to sleep. Oh I'd love it. 
 Merryweather: , You really think we can? 
 Flora: ," If humans can do it, so can we. "
 Merryweather: , And we have our magic to help us. 
 Fauna: , That's right. 
 Flora: ," Oh, no, no, no, no, no magic! I'll take those wands right now. Oh, better get rid of those wings, too. "
 Merryweather: ," You mean, live like mortals? For sixteen years?   Now, we don't know how. We've never done anything without magic. "
 Flora: , And that's why Maleficent will never suspect. 
 Merryweather: ," But who'll wash, and cook? "
 Flora: ," Oh, we'll all pitch in. "
 Fauna: , I'll take care of the baby! 
 Flora: ," Let me have it, dear.   "
 Flora: ," Come along now, We must tell their majesties at once. "
 Fauna: , Flora! 
 Merryweather: , Flora! 
 Narrator: ," So the king and his queen watched with heavy hearts as their most precious posession, their only child, disappeared into the night. "
 Narrator: ," Many sad and lonely years passed by for King Stefan and his people. But as the time for the princesses sixteenth birthday drew near, the entire kingdom began to rejoice. For everyone knew that as long as Maleficent's domain, the forbidden mountains, thundered with her wrath and frustration, her evil prophecy had not yet been fulfilled. "
 Maleficent: ," It's incredible, sixteen years and not a trace of her! She couldn't have vanished into thin air. Are you sure you searched everywhere? "
 1st servant: ," yeah, yeah, anywhere, we all ... "
 2nd servant: ," yeah, yeah! "
 Maleficent: ," But what about the town, the forests, the mountains? "
 1st servant: ," We searched mountains, forests, and houses, and let me see, in all the cradles. "
 Maleficent: , Cradle? 
 1st servant: ," Yeah, yeah, every cradle. "
 Maleficent: ,"   Cradle?   Did you hear that my pet? All these years, they've been looking for a baby!   oh, oh, ha, ha, ha ... "
 Servants: ,"   ha, ha, ha ... "
 Maleficent: ,"     Fools! Idiots! Imbeciles!     Oh, they're hopeless. A disgrace to the forces of evil.   My pet, you are my last hope. Circle far and wide, search for a maid of sixteen with hair of sunshine gold and lips red as the rose. Go, and do not fail me.   "
 Narrator: ," And so for sixteen long years the whereabouts of the princess remained a mystery, while deep in the forest, in a woodcutter's cottage, the good fairies carried out their well-laid plan. Living like mortals, they had reared the child as their own and called her Briar Rose. "
 Narrator: , On this her sixteenth birthday the good fairies had planned a party and something extra special for her surprise. 
 Merryweather: , How about this one? 
 Flora: , This is the one I picked. 
 Fauna: , Oh she'll look beautiful in it. 
 Flora: , Now I thought a few changes here ... 
 Merryweather: , Aha 
 Fauna: , Don't forget a pretty bow ... 
 Flora: , And there's the shoulder line. 
 Merryweather: , We'll make it blue. 
 Flora: ," Oh no, dear, pink. "
 Merryweather: , But ... 
 Flora: ," Of course, we'll need a few pleats "
 Fauna: ," Yes, but how are we going to get her out of the house? "
 Flora: ," Oh, I'll think of something. "
 Briar Rose: ," Well, and what are you three dears up to? "
 Merryweather: , Up to? 
 Fauna: , Up to? 
 Flora: , Up to? 
 Flora: ," eh, eh, eh, we, we, well, we, we ... "
 Merryweather: , Want you to pick some berries. 
 Flora: ," That's it, berries! "
 Briar Rose: , Berries? 
 Fauna: , Lots of berries. 
 Briar Rose: , But I picked berries yesterday. 
 Flora: ," Oh, we need more, dear. "
 Fauna: ," Lots, lots more. "
 Flora: , Yes! 
 Flora: ," Now don't hurry back, dear. "
 Merryweather: , And don't go to far. 
 Flora: , And don't speak to strangers. 
 Fauna: ," Goodbye, dear! "
 Merryweather: , Goodbye! 
 Flora: , Goodbye! 
 Briar Rose: , Goodbye! 
 Merryweather: , I wonder if she suspects. 
 Flora: ," Of course not, come on. Will she be surprised! "
 Merryweather: , A real birthday party. 
 Fauna: , With a real birthday cake. 
 Flora: ," Yes, and a dress a princess can be proud of. "
 Merryweather: , I'll get the wands. 
 Flora: ," Yes, you ... the wands? "
 Fauna: , Oh no. 
 Flora: , No magic! 
 Merryweather: , But the sixteen years are almost over. 
 Flora: , We're taking no chances. 
 Merryweather: ," But, I never baked a fancy cake. "
 Flora: ," Oh, you won't have to, dear. "
 Fauna: , I'm going to bake the cake. 
 Merryweather: , You? 
 Flora: ," She's always wanted to, dear, and this is her last chance. "
 Merryweather: ," Well, ... "
 Fauna: ," I'm going to make it fifteen layers with pink and blue, forgive-me-nots ... "
 Flora: , And i'm making the dress. 
 Merryweather: ," But you can't sow, and she's never cooked! "
 Flora: ," Oh, it's simple. "
 Fauna: , All you do is follow the book. 
 Flora: ," Up here dear, you can be the dummy. "
 Merryweather: ," Well, I still say we ought to use magic. "
 Fauna: ,"   Flour, three cups.   Cups, cups, cups, cups, cups ...   One, two, three. "
 Merryweather: , What's that for? 
 Flora: ," Well, it's got to have a hole in the bottom. "
 Fauna: , That's for the feet to go through. 
 Merryweather: , It's pink! 
 Flora: ," Oh, lovely shade, isn't it. "
 Merryweather: , But I wanted it blue. 
 Flora: ," Now, dear, we decided pink was her color. "
 Merryweather: , You decided! 
 Fauna: ,"   Two eggs, fold in gently Fold? Oh well. "
 Merryweather: , I can't breathe! 
 Merryweather: , It looks awful. 
 Flora: ," That's because it's on you, dear. "
 Fauna: ,"   Now yeast, one tsp. tsp? "
 Merryweather: , One teaspoon! 
 Fauna: ," One teaspoon, of course. "
 Flora: , Oh gracious how the child has grown. 
 Merryweather: ," Oh, it seems only yesterday we brought her here. "
 Fauna: , Just a tiny baby. 
 Flora: , Why Merryweather! 
 Fauna: ," Whatever's the matter, dear? "
 Merryweather: ," After the day she'll be a princess, and we won't have any Briar Rose. "
 Fauna: , Oh Flora! 
 Flora: , We all knew this day had to come. 
 Fauna: , But why did it have to come so soon? 
 Flora: ," After all, we've had her for sixteen years. "
 Merryweather: , Sixteen wonderful years. 
 Flora: ," Good gracious, We're acting like a lot of ninnies! Come on, she'll be back before we get started. "
 Phillip: ,"   Hear that, Samson? Beautiful! What is it? Come on, let's find out.   Oh, come on! For an extra bucket of oats, and a few carrots?   Hop boy! "
 Phillip: , Ohhh! 
 Phillip: , No carrots! 
 Briar Rose: ," I wonder, I wonder, I wonder why each little bird Has a someone to sing to Sweet things to A gay little love melody. I wonder, I wonder, If my heart keeps singing Will my song go wing-ing To someone Who'll find me And bring back a love song To me! "
 Briar Rose: ," Oh dear, why do they still treat me like a child. "
 Owl: , Who? 
 Briar Rose: ," Why, Flora and Fauna and Merryweather. They never want me to meet anyone.   But you know something? I fooled 'em. I have met someone! "
 Owl: , Who? Who? Who?   
 Briar Rose: ," Oh, a prince. Well, he's tall and handsome and ... and so romantic. Oh we walked together, and talked together, and just before we say goodbye, he takes me in his arms, and then ... I wake up.   "
 Briar Rose: ," Yes, it's only in my dreams. But they say if you dream a thing more than once, It's sure to come true. And I've seen him so many times! "
 Phillip: ," You know samson, There was something strange about that voice. Too beautiful to be real. Maybe it was a mysterious being, a wood sprite ...   There, stop! "
 Briar Rose: ," Oh, why, it's my dream prince!   Your highness! No, I'm really not supposed to speak to strangers. But we've met before!   I know you I walked with you Once upon a dream I know you The gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam "
 Briar Rose: , And I know it's true That visions are seldom all they seem But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you did Once upon a dream 
 Briar Rose: , But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once   
 Both: , The way you did   
 Phillip: , Once upon a dream 
 Briar Rose: , Oh?   Oh!   
 Phillip: , I'm awfully sorry. I didn't mean to frighten you. 
 Briar Rose: ," Oh it wasn't that. It's just that you're a, a ... "
 Phillip: , A stranger? 
 Briar Rose: , Hmm-hmm. 
 Phillip: , But don't you remember? We've met before! 
 Briar Rose: ," We, we have? "
 Phillip: ," Of course, You said so yourself: Once upon a dream!   I know you I walked with you Once upon a dream I know you The gleam in your eyes Is so familiar a gleam "
 Choir: , And I know it's true That visions are seldom all they seem But if I know you I know what you'll do You'll love me at once The way you did Once upon a dream 
 Phillip: ," Who are you, what's your name? "
 Briar Rose: ," Hmm? Oh, my name. Why, it's, it's ... Oh no, no, I can't, I ... Goodbye!   "
 Phillip: , But when will I see you again? 
 Briar Rose: ," Oh never, never! "
 Phillip: , Never? 
 Briar Rose: ," Well, maybe someday. "
 Phillip: ," When, tomorrow? "
 Briar Rose: ," Oh no, this evening. "
 Phillip: , Where? 
 Briar Rose: ," At the cottage, in the glen. "
 Fauna: ," Well, what do you think of it? "
 Flora: ," Why, it's a very unusual cake, isn't it? "
 Fauna: , Yes. Of course it'll be much stiffer after it's bake. 
 Flora: ," Of course, dear. What do you think of the dress? "
 Fauna: ," Well, it's not exactly the way it is in the book, is it? "
 Flora: ," Well, I improved a bit! But perhaps if I added few more ruffolds? What do you think? "
 Fauna: ," I think so. What do you think, Merryweather? "
 Merryweather: ,"   I think we've had enough of this nonsense. I think we ought to think of Rose, and what she'll think of this mess. I still think what I thunk before. I'm going to get those wands.   "
 Fauna: ," You know, I think she's right. "
 Merryweather: ," Here they are, good as new. "
 Flora: ," Careful, Merryweather! Quick, lock the doors. Flora, you close the windows. Pluck up every cranny, We can't take any chances! And now,   you take care of the cake, "
 Merryweather: , While I ... 
 Flora: ," Clean the room, dear, And I'll make the dress. Well, hurry! "
 Merryweather: ," Come on, bucket, mob, broom, Flora says, clean up the room!   "
 Flora: ," And now to make a lovely dress, fit the grace of fair princess.   "
 Fauna: ," Eggs, flour, milk,   just do it the way it's here in the book. I'll put on the candles.   "
 Merryweather: ," Oh no, not pink. Make it blue.   "
 Flora: , Merryweather! Make it pink.   
 Merryweather: , Blue.   
 Flora: , Pink.   
 Merryweather: , Blue.   
 Flora: , Look what you've done! 
 Fauna: ," Shh, listen!   "

 Flora: ,"   Make it pink.   Now hide, quick. "
 Merryweather: , Blue.   
 Briar Rose: ," And Flora, "
 Flora: ," Good gracious, who left the mob running? "

 Hubert: , You have? where? 
 Phillip: , Once upon a dream.   
 Hubert: ," Oh Phillip, stop it, stop that, why, Phillip, Put me down!   Now, what's all this dream nonsense? "
 Phillip: ," It wasn't a dream, father. I really did meet her! "
 Hubert: ," Princess Aurora? Good heavens, we must tell Stefan! Why this is the most ... "
 Phillip: , I didn't say it was Aurora. 
 Hubert: ," You most certainly did, you said ... "
 Phillip: ," I said I met the girl I was going to marry. I don't know who she was, a peasant girl I suppose. "
 Hubert: ," A peasant g-g-girl? You're going to marry a ... Why Phillip, you're joking!   isn't he?   You can't do this to me! Give up the throne, the kingdom, for some, some nobody? By Harry, I won't have it. You're a prince, and you're going to marry a princess! "
 Phillip: ," Now father, you're living in the past. This is the fourteenth century. Nowadays ... "
 Hubert: ," Nowadays I'm still the king, and I command you to come to your senses. "
 Phillip: , ... and marry the girl I love. 
 Hubert: , Exactly! 
 Phillip: ," Goodbye, father!   "
 Hubert: ," Goodbye, father! Marry the girl you ... No, no, Phillip, stop, come back, hold Phillip! Phillip! Oh, how will I ever tell Stefan? "
 Flora: ," All right, in here, dear. "
 Merryweather: ,   
 Flora: ," Lock the door, Merryweather! Fauna, pull the drapes! And now, dear, if you'll just sit here. This one last gift, dear child for thee, the symbol of thy royalty. A crown to wear in grace and beauty, as is thy right, and royal duty. "
 Fauna: ," Now, dear. "
 Flora: ," Come, let her have a few moments alone.   "
 Merryweather: , It's that boy she met. 
 Fauna: , Whatever are we going to do? 
 Merryweather: , I don't see why she has to marry any old prince. 
 Fauna: ," Now, that's not for us to decide, dear. "
 Fauna: , Maybe we should tell King Stefan about the boy. 
 Merryweather: ," Well, why don't we? "
 Flora: , Listen! Maleficent! 
 Fairies: ," Rose, Rose! "
 Flora: , Oh why did we leave her alone? 
 Fairies: ," Rose, Rose! "
 Fairies: ," Rose, Rose! Where are you? Rose! "
 Fairies: , Rose! 
 Fairies: , Rose! Don't touch anything! 
 Maleficent: , Touch the spindle. Touch it I say! 
 Fairies: , Oh! 
 Maleficent: ," You poor simple fools. Thinking you could defeat me, me, the mistress of all evil. Well, here's your precious princess. "
 Fauna: , Rose! 
 Flora: ," Oh Rose! Oh, I'll never forgive myself. "
 Fauna: , We're all to blame! 
 Hubert: ," Stefan, there's something important I have to tell you. "
 Stefan: ," Not now, Hubert. "
 Hubert: , But it's about Phillip. 
 Stefan: ," Phillip, oh yes, of course, Phillip, why, where is the boy? "
 Hubert: , That's what i'm telling to tell you. 
 Stefan: ," Well, send for him immediately! "
 Hubert: , But ... 
 Announcer: ," The sun has set, make ready to welcome your princess! "
 Fauna: , Poor King Stefan and the Queen. 
 Merryweather: , They'll be heartbroken when they find out. 
 Flora: , They're not going to. 
 Merryweather: , They aren't? 
 Flora: ," We'll put them all to sleep, until Rose awakens. Come! "
 Hubert: ," Well, just been talking to Phillip. Seems he's fallen in love with some peasant girl. "
 Flora: ," Peasant girl? Yes, yes? The peasant girl, who is she? Where did he meet her? "
 Hubert: , Just some peasant girl he met. 
 Flora: ," Where, where? "
 Hubert: , Once upon a dream.   
 Flora: ," Once upon a dr... Rose! Prince Phillip!   Come on, we've got to get back to the cottage! "
 Maleficent: , Come in! 
 Maleficent: ,"   Well, this is a pleasant surprise. I set my trap for a peasant, and lo! I catch a prince!   Away with him. But gently, my pets, gently, I have plans for our royal guest. "
 Fairies: , Maleficent! 
 Merryweather: , She's got Prince Phillip! 
 Flora: , At the forbidden mountain. 
 Fauna: ," But we can't, we can't go there! "
 Flora: ," We can, and we must. "
 Maleficent: ,"   What a pity prince Phillip can't be here to enjoy the celebration. Come, we must go to the dungeon and cheer him up. "
 Maleficent: ," Oh come now, prince Phillip. Why so melancholy? A wondrous future lies before you. You, the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true. "
 Maleficent: ," Behold, King Stefan's castle, and in yonder topmost tower, dreaming of her true love, the princess Aurora. But see the gracious whim of fate. Why, 'tis the self same peasant maid, who won the heart of our noble prince but yesterday. She is indeed most wondrous fair. Gold of sunshine in her hair, lips that shame the red, red rose. In ageless sleep she finds repose. The years roll by, but a hundred years to a steadfast heart are 'bout a day. And now, the gates of the dungeon part, and the prince is free to go his way. Off he rides on his noble steed ... "

 Flora: ," Watch out, Phillip! "
 Flora: ," Hurry, hurry, Phillip! "

 Flora: ,   Hop! come this way 
 Maleficent: ,   
 Flora: ," Now sword of truth fly swift and sure, That evil die and good endure! "
 Stefan: ," Oh, ah, forgive me, Hubert, the wine ... Now, you were saying? "
